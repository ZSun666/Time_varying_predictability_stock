# Time_varying_predictability_stock
This is the replication code for 'Time-varying predictability of stock return with high-dimensional data'.

In this paper, we propose a particle filter with variational Bayes (PF-VB) algorithm to estimate the time-varying parameters predictive model with high-dimensional dataset. 

We predict the S&P 500 stock return with proposed method, and compare it with other methods.
